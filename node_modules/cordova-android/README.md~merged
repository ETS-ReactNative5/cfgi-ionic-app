Cordova Android is an Android application library that allows for Cordova-based projects to be built for the Android Platform. Cordova based applications are, at the core, applications written with web technology: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Requirements

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 11
* [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Create a Cordova project

Follow the instructions in the [**Create your first Cordova app**](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html) section of [Apache Cordova Docs](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/)

To use a **shared framework**, for example in development, link the appropriate cordova-android platform folder path:

```bash
cordova platform add --link /path/to/cordova-android
```

## Updating a Cordova project

When you install a new version of the [`Cordova CLI`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova) that pins a new version of the [`Cordova-Android`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-android) platform, you can follow these simple upgrade steps within your project:

```bash
cordova platform rm android
cordova platform add android
```

## Debugging in Android Studio

Import project in Android Studio through _File > Open_ and targeting `/path/to/your-cdv-project/platforms/android/`.

## How to Test Repo Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Requires

- Java JDK 1.8
- Android SDK [http://developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/)

## Cordova Android Developer Tools

We recommend using the [Cordova command-line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova) to create projects and be able to easily install plugins.

However, the following scripts can be used instead:

    ./bin/create [path package activity] ... creates the ./example app or a cordova android project
    ./bin/check_reqs ....................... checks that your environment is set up for cordova-android development
    ./bin/update [path] .................... updates an existing cordova-android project to the version of the framework

These commands live in a generated Cordova Android project. Any interactions with the emulator require you to have an AVD defined.

    ./cordova/clean ........................ cleans the project
    ./cordova/build ........................ calls `clean` then compiles the project
    ./cordova/log   ........................ streams device or emulator logs to STDOUT
    ./cordova/run   ........................ calls `build` then deploys to a connected Android device. If no Android device is detected, will launch an emulator and deploy to it.
    ./cordova/version ...................... returns the cordova-android version of the current project

## Using Android Studio

1. Create a project
2. Import it via "Non-Android Studio Project"

## Running the Native Tests

The `test/` directory in this project contains an Android test project that can be used to run different kinds of native tests. Check out the [README contained therein](test/README.md) for more details!
